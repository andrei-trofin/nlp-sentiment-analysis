<h1 style="text-align: center"> NLP Sentiment Analysis ðŸ§ </h1>

## Business Case

This project has been created by going through the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyDmQggfsZ0
and adapting it to fit my work style.

In this project written sentences are analyzed and classified as being negative, positive or in-between.
This type of application is useful for any type of app to improve its marketing.
For example, we can monitor the good and bad reviews in an A/B test environment
and modify our product accordingly.

There emotions in this dataset range from 0 = negative, to 4 = positive, while 2
= neutral. The dataset was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).
